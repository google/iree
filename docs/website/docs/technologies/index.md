# Technologies

IREE at it's core is an integration of multiple technologies including:

- [MLIR](./mlir.md)
- [SPIRV](./spirv.md)
- [TOSA](./tosa.md)

Users are free to make improvements to any of IREE's core technologies,
however changes must be upstreamed to their corresponding projects. This
section seeks to document the process and relevant information about each
project for interested contributors.
