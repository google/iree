//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//
// Generic microkernel library
//===----------------------------------------------------------------------===//
// This library is focused on supporting usage of tiled microkernels from both
// runtime libraries (VMVX via the IREE VM) and compiled libraries (LLVM CPU
// codegen). It is designed to compile standalone as well as to bitcode that
// can be linked into generated libraries and has support for specialization
// in the compiler. In general treat the code as portable across architectures
// but consistently built for bare-metal systems with no stdlib.
//
// Code here must not use any system headers - as almost all pull in bits/ and
// various other target-dependent definitions that make the resulting IR
// non-portable. This means there is no size_t, etc. Any definitions that may
// come from an std* file must be redefined here with care. Target-specific
// files may include target-specific headers if carefully managed.
//
// Code must also not use any mutable global or thread-local state ala
// errno/rounding modes/etc. Each of the functions in the library will be called
// concurrently from multiple threads and from multiple source modules. There
// must be no mutable static values anywhere.
//
// Avoid #ifdef entirely where possible: they indicate a leakage of host build
// configuration into what is supposed to be a portable module. Anything that
// requires target-specific conditional logic must be implemented via an extern
// that can be substituted by the IREE compiler when producing the final
// target-specific module.

// Include the build-system-generated configured header and use it as the only
// source of information about the target we're compiling against, as opposed to
// including iree/base/target_platform.h.
//
// For example, using IREE_UKERNEL_ARCH_ARM_64 (from arch/config.h) rather than
// IREE_ARCH_ARM_64 (from target_platform.h) means that we can control from a
// single place in the build system whether we enable ARM_64-specific code paths
// or stick to generic code.
#include "iree/builtins/ukernel/arch/config.h"

// We require that this header compile on bare-metal targets with no stdlib.
// These headers are clean:
#include "iree/base/attributes.h"

// NOTE: prefer not using size_t/ptrdiff_t/etc (as they are target dependent).
// We avoid including the toolchain file as it may not match with the target
// information we have in the IREE compiler. They're also generally tire fires
// that significantly bloat the bitcode we build and link into binaries: stdint
// on Windows includes windows.h, for example.
//
// NOTE: callers must #include <stdint.h> before this header; unfortunately
// there's not a great way to redefine these in the absence of stdint.h that
// also operates with stdint.h.
