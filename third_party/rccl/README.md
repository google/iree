# The declaration-only header for RCCL

The header is copied from a build of RCCL 2.18.6 (Git tag `rocm-6.1.0`).

This declaration-only header is required to query the dynamically injected
RCCL API at runtime. See the following for more information:

* [RCCL Documentation](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/projects/rccl/en/latest/index.html)
* [Repository](https://github.com/ROCm/rccl)
