# Buildkite Agent Hooks

Agent hooks to be installed on the buildkite agents. See
https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/hooks. Each hook file is prefixed with the
name of the hook. Note that It should be deployed on agents under that name
rather than its full name.

Note that "repository" or "local" hooks are located at
"build_tools/buildkite/repository_hooks".
