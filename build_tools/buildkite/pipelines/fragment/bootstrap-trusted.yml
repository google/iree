# Pipeline configuration to upload to the UI for trusted pipelines

agents:

  security: "trusted"

steps:
  # TODO: investigate enabling presubmit config testing from trusted forks.
  # If running from the main repository, bootstrap the checked-in bootstrap
  # pipeline. This replaces the rest of the steps (which are waiting on this
  # one).
  # Skip when running locally because Buildkite cli doesn't support replacing
  # pipelines (https://github.com/buildkite/cli/issues/122). This isn't too big
  # a limitation because presumably we're already running with the local file
  # that would be bootstrapped.
