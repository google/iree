# Pipeline configuration to register with Buidlkite for untrusted pipelines

steps:
  # Bootstrap the checked-in bootstrap pipeline. This replaces the rest of the
  # steps (which are waiting on this one).
  # Skip when running locally because Buildkite cli doesn't support replacing
  # pipelines (https://github.com/buildkite/cli/issues/122). This isn't too big
  # a limitation because presumably we're already running with the local file
  # that would be bootstrapped.
